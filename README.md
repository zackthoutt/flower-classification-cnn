# Classifying flowers using a CNN

Convolusional Neural Networks (CNN) are commonly used in image/video analysis. They work well by applying dozens of filters over the images and looking at progressively more detailed features. In this way, CNNs can learn patterns, textures, shapes, etc. This project uses VGGNet (the 2016 winner for the best image classification model) to extract features from images of flowers and categorize them. This CNN was able to achieve **90% accuracy** on the flower dataset.
